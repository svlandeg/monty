/// This trait captures the two responsibilities shared by all heap-stored types:
///
/// 1. **Memory estimation** (`py_estimate_size`): reporting approximate byte footprint
///    for resource tracking and memory limit enforcement.
///
/// 2. **Reference collection** (`py_dec_ref_ids`): collecting contained `HeapId`s during
///    reference count decrement so child objects can be freed iteratively.
///
/// Unlike `PyTrait`, which provides Python-level operations (equality, repr, arithmetic),
/// `HeapItem` is purely about heap lifecycle management. This separation allows types like
/// `Closure` and `FunctionDefaults` to participate in heap bookkeeping without needing
/// the full `PyTrait` interface.
///
/// Every `HeapData` variant must implement this trait (either directly on the inner type,
/// or inline in the dispatch for types we don't own like `String`).
